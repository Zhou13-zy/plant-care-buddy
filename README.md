# Plant Care Buddy ðŸŒ±

A digital plant care management system designed to help users track and maintain their houseplant collection. It enables plant enthusiasts to monitor plant health, schedule care activities, document growth with photos, and receive timely care reminders.

## Features

### Plant Management
- Plant listing and details view
- Add and edit plant information
- Plant type classification
- Photo management for plants

### Health Tracking
- Add and edit health observations
- Track plant health status
- Document plant issues and improvements
- Health history tracking

### Care Events
- Record care activities (watering, fertilizing, etc.)
- Edit care event details
- View care history
- Track care event dates

### Care Recommendations
- Plant-specific care strategies
- Seasonal care adjustments
- Watering frequency recommendations
- Fertilizing schedule
- Light and humidity recommendations
- Next care dates calculation

### Care Planning & Reminders
- Create, edit, and delete care reminders for any plant
- Support for recurring reminders (custom interval-based, extensible for more patterns)
- Strategy-aware reminders
- Dashboard integration
- Custom reminders for special needs

### How Reminders Work

**Reminder Generation**
- The system uses the plant's care strategy and care history to determine the next due date for each care type.
- If a care event (e.g., watering) exists, the next reminder is scheduled for the recommended interval after the last event.
- If no care event exists, the reminder is scheduled for today (first-time care).

**Reminder Completion**
- Marking a reminder as complete logs a care event.
- For recurring reminders, the next occurrence is automatically scheduled based on the recurrence pattern and the date of completion.

**Recurrence System Extensibility**
- The recurrence system is designed to be extensible, with support for advanced patterns (weekly, monthly, specific days, end dates, occurrence counts, etc.) planned for future releases.

## Technical Overview

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Package Manager**: npm

#### Backend
- **Framework**: .NET 8
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture

- **Database**: SQL Server
- **API**: RESTful with ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Real-time Updates**: SignalR
- **File Storage**: Local file system (with interface for cloud storage)

#### Development Tools
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Database Management**: SQL Server Management Studio
- **API Testing**: Swagger

### Architecture & Design Patterns

#### Core Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**
  - Abstracts and encapsulates data access logic
  - Separates business logic from data access
  - Improves maintainability and testability
  - Provides consistent data access interface

- **Strategy Pattern**
  - Enables flexible, plant-specific care recommendations
  - Encapsulates different care algorithms
  - Allows runtime strategy selection
  - Supports strategy sharing and adaptation

- **DTO Pattern**
  - Defines data transfer objects for API communication
  - Decouples internal models from API contracts
  - Improves security and versioning
  - Controls data exposure

- **Service Layer Pattern**
  - Organizes business logic into dedicated services
  - Centralizes business rules and validation
  - Improves maintainability and testability
  - Handles complex operations and orchestration

- **Reminder Entity & Recurrence Pattern**
  - Stores each care task as a persistent, editable record
  - Supports flexible recurrence (currently using custom interval-based recurrence; fields for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, days of week, day of month, end date, and occurrence count are present and ready for future use)
  - Reminders are generated based on care strategies and the plant's actual care history (e.g., last watering/fertilizing event)
  - Marking a reminder as complete logs a care event and, if recurring, schedules the next due date based on the current completion date and recurrence interval
  - Enables completion tracking, snooze, and care history
